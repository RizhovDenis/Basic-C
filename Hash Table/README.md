# Description
This Hash Table with data generator.
* header.h - contain struct hash table and functions prototypes;
* function.h - has static and visible functions;
* main.h - work place, where is realised collision cheaker.
## Instruction
Hash function turn key to hash_key as multiplication bites of each letter in this key and division on capacity.
* On 10000 generated items 7873 collision;
* On 100000 - 98103.
## Possible improvments
I think I can try to create generator better then now. And maybe other hash-function will be better.
